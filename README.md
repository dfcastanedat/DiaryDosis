League of Legends API Interaction Project
=========================================

This Python project facilitates interaction with the League of Legends API. It allows users to make HTTP requests to the endpoint `/lol/spectator/v5/active-games/by-summoner/{encryptedPUUID}` using a specific encrypted PUUID (`hlpuNrEuoN6SijjQnbi3Qww7Jj75stvLHSd4XwVTlNjzXnTkvJe9v4AutMbim55G9jptzWz2HTA5Kw`). Additionally, it involves editing and running a `.bat` script that utilizes the mentioned PUUID and a game encryption key for specific operations related to the game.

Project Overview
----------------

The project includes functionalities to handle HTTP requests, process API responses, interact with the `.bat` script, and potentially perform other operations based on the retrieved data from the League of Legends API. The primary goal is to create a streamlined process for accessing game information and performing actions using the provided encrypted PUUID and encryption key.

Features
--------

*   Interact with League of Legends API
*   Make HTTP requests to the specified endpoint
*   Process API responses
*   Edit and execute a `.bat` script for game-related operations
*   Handle game encryption key for security
*   Spectate the ongoing game using the League of Legends Spectator feature

Usage
-----

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/league-of-legends-api.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

bash

Copy code

`cd league-of-legends-api`

3.  Install the required dependencies:

bash

Copy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  Edit the `.bat` script with your specific game encryption key.
    
5.  Run the Python script to interact with the League of Legends API:
